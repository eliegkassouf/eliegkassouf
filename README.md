### üëã Hey! Welcome to my GitHub Page.

I enjoy designing and building software/solutions that allow anyone to run profitable and efficient businesses.

I enjoy tuning and working on cars/motorcycles. 

When I'm not working on code or cars, I occasionally enjoy tracking my motorcycle and practicing the piano.

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi, my name is Elie Kassouf.

I'm a team player and work well alone (not as fun). 

I leaped into the unknown, becoming the CTO at JobSite360. The workload was tremendous and seemed impossible for a minute. Through hard work and dedication, I see progressive and positive results with each day that passes. 

- Work smart and hard. Nothing comes easy! üìö
- I'm trilingual (English, French, and Arabic).
- Vast experience facilitating cutting-edge engineering solutions with a wide range of complex application and technology skills.
- Proven ability to leverage full-stack knowledge and experience building interactive user-centred website designs and native mobile applications to scale.
- Extensive expertise in significant system architecture development, administration, and network design and configuration.
- Extensive Expertise in Fintech (Plaid, Stripe..)
- Expertise in AI


To live in the past is to die in the future.
