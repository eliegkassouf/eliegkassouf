### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hi, my name is Elie Kassouf.

About Me & My Last Role:

I spearheaded the complete redesign and development of JobSite360 Services, transforming the existing codebase to significantly improve performance and functionality. The initial system, provided by then-CEO Peter Douglas, was an amalgamation of code from three separate companies, resulting in frequent crashes and synchronization issues with the mobile app.

Within six months, I successfully rebuilt the entire suite of services from scratch, with continuous improvements and iterations over the following months. I utilized Java Play and Scala for the prototype but later opted for a modularized architecture, retaining the high-performing Java Play backend while replacing Scala components with an Angular 8 frontend. Over the years, I upgraded the application from Angular 8 to Angular 15, leveraging two-way binding for optimal performance.

Throughout the development process, I authored numerous libraries, components, directives, services, and interfaces, primarily using TypeScript due to its strong typing and ability to minimize debugging and technical debt. To further enhance the application, I implemented a socket server using Node.JS, Express, and Socket.IO for real-time chat functionality and reduced load on certain features. Additionally, I developed reporting services and reports with PHP, taking advantage of its lightweight nature and PDF generation capabilities.

By segregating services, I achieved a remarkable 90% reduction in operating costs. My extensive experience with libraries such as Syncfusion, Angular Material, Google Maps, and countless others has been honed over seven years of working with Angular.

I have managed various services on local Linux, Mac, and Windows servers for prototyping and simulating production-like environments. My expertise extends to Google Cloud, Google Admin, AWS (EC2, RDS, S3), and Heroku (scaling dynos, utilizing plugins like Heroku Postgres, Firewall services, Logging services, etc.).

In addition, I possess experience in AI and Fintech, having integrated Plaid for banking support (covering up to 12,000 banks) and Stripe for invoicing. These integrations facilitated data import for OpenAI, which in turn accelerated features and offered valuable insights.

My responsibilities also encompassed testing, documentation, hiring, and enforcing a "clean code" policy. I provided mentorship for team members and collaborated closely with clients to enhance the product. As the sole executive with an IT background, I assumed a critical leadership role in the absence of the CEO, guiding the team towards the successful delivery of a high-quality product.
